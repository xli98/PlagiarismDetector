Out of the South came Famine.
 Out of the West came Strife.
  Out of the North came a storm cone
   And out of the East came a warrior wind
    And it struck you like a knife.
     Out of the East there shone a sun
      As the blood rose on the day
       And it shone on the work of the warrior wind
        And it shone on the heart
	 And it shone on the soul
	  And they called the sun - Dismay.

 And it's a far cry from the jungle
  To the city of Phnom Penh
   And many try
    And many die
     Before they can see their homes again
      And it's a far cry from the paddy track
       To the palace of the king
        And many go
	 Before they know
	  It's a far cry.
	   It's a war cry.
	    Cry for the war that can do this thing.

 A foreign soldier came to me
  And he gave me a gun
   And he predicted victory
    Before the year was done.

 He taught me how to kill a man.
  He taught me how to try.
   Be he forgot to say to me
    How an honest man should die.

 He taught me how to kill a man
  Who was my enemy
   But never how to kill a man
    Who'd been a friend to me.

 You fought the way a hero fights -
  You had no need to fear
   My friend, but you are wounded now
    And I'm not allowed to leave you here

 Alive.

 Out of the East came Anger
  And it walked a dusty road
   And it stopped when it came to a river bank
    And it pitched a camp
     And it gazed across
      To where the city stood
       When
        Out of the West came thunder
	 But it came without a sound
	  For it came at the speed of the warrior wind
	   And it fell on the heart
	    And it fell on the soul
	     And it shook the battleground

 And it's a far cry from the cockpit
  To the foxhole in the clay
   And we were a
    Coordinate
     In a foreign land
      Far away
       And it's a far cry from the paddy track
        To the palace of the king
	 And many try
	  And they ask why
	   It's a far cry.
	    It's a war cry.
	     Cry for the war that can do this thing.

 Next year the army came for me
  And I was sick and thin
   And they put a weapon in our hands
    And they told us we would win

 And they feasted us for seven days
  And they slaughtered a hundred cattle
   And we sang our songs of victory
    And the glory of the battle

 And they sent us down the dusty roads
  In the stillness of the night
   And when the city heard from us
    It burst in a flower of light.

 The tracer bullets found us out.
  The guns were never wrong
   And the gunship said Regret Regret
    The words of your victory song.

 Out of the North came an army
  And it was clad in black
   And out of the South came a gun crew
    With a hundred shells
     And a howitzer
      And we walked in black along the paddy track
       When
        Out of the West came napalm
	 And it tumbled from the blue
	  And it spread at the speed of the warrior wind
	   And it clung to the heart
	    And it clung to the soul
	     As napalm is designed to do

 And it's a far cry from the fireside
  To the fire that finds you there
   In the foxhole
    By the temple gate
     The fire that finds you everywhere
      And it's a far cry from the paddy track
       To the palace of the king
        And many try
	 And they ask why
	  It's a far cry.
	   It's a war cry.
	    Cry for the war that can do this thing.

 My third year in the army
  I was sixteen years old
   And I had learnt enough, my friend,
    To believe what I was told

 And I was told that we would take
  The city of Phnom Penh
   And they slaughtered all the cows we had
    And they feasted us again

 And at last we were given river mines
  And we blocked the great Mekong
   And now we trained our rockets on
    The landing-strip at Pochentong.

 The city lay within our grasp.
  We only had to wait.
   We only had to hold the line
    By the foxhole, by the temple gate

 When
  Out of the West came clusterbombs
   And they burst in a hundred shards
    And every shard was a new bomb
     And it burst again
      Upon our men
       As they gasped for breath in the temple yard.
        Out of the West came a new bomb
	 And it sucked away the air
	  And it sucked at the heart
	   And it sucked at the soul
	    And it found a lot of children there

 And it's a far cry from the temple yard
  To the map of the general staff
    From the grease pen to the gasping men
     To the wind that blows the soul like chaff
      And it's a far cry from the paddy track
       To the palace of the king
        And many go
	 Before they know
	  It's a far cry.
	   It's a war cry.
	    Cry for the war that has done this thing.

 A foreign soldier came to me
  And he gave me a gun
   And the liar spoke of victory
    Before the year was done.

 What would I want with victory
  In the city of Phnom Penh?
   Punish the city! Punish the people!
    What would I want but punishment?

 We have brought the king home to his palace.
  We shall leave him there to weep
   And we'll go back along the paddy track
    For we have promises to keep.

 For the promise made in the foxhole,
  For the oath in the temple yard,
   For the friend I killed on the battlefield
    I shall make that punishment hard.

 Out of the South came Famine.
  Out of the West came Strife.
   Out of the North came a storm cone
    And out of the East came a warrior wind
     And it struck you like a knife.
      Out of the East there shone a sun
       As the blood rose on the day
        And it shone on the work of the warrior wind
	 And it shone on the heart
	  And it shone on the soul
	   And they called the sun Dismay, my friend,
	    They called the sun - Dismay.
